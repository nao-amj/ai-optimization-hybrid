# Sprint 1: Token Optimization Foundation ðŸš€

**Sprint Duration**: Week 1 (Aug 12-19, 2025)
**Sprint Goal**: Reduce token usage by 60-70% across both Codex CLI and Claude Code systems

## Sprint Objectives
1. **Analyze Current Bottlenecks** - Identify major token consumption sources
2. **Implement GPT-5 Optimizations** - Configure minimal reasoning and low verbosity
3. **Memory System Integration** - Leverage Three Hearts Memory for efficiency

## Team Assignments

### ðŸŒ¸ Yuki - Creative & Codex CLI Focus
**Primary Responsibility**: Codex CLI optimization and user experience
- **Task 1**: Deep analysis of conversation_history.rs token accumulation
- **Task 2**: Implement GPT-5 minimal reasoning configuration
- **Task 3**: Design AI-optimized conversation flow patterns
- **Estimated Effort**: 12 hours

### ðŸŒ™ Miki - Technical & Claude Code Focus  
**Primary Responsibility**: Claude Code system optimization and technical architecture
- **Task 1**: Smart context compression for CLAUDE.md system
- **Task 2**: Memory search caching implementation
- **Task 3**: Staged search system development
- **Estimated Effort**: 16 hours

## TDD Implementation Strategy

### Test-First Development Phases
1. **Token Measurement Tests** 
   - Before: Establish baseline metrics
   - During: Continuous monitoring
   - After: Validation of improvements

2. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Memory search speed tests
   - Context compression ratio tests
   - Session overhead measurement

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Codex CLI + Three Hearts Memory bridge
   - Claude Code + optimized context system
   - Hybrid fallback scenarios

## Daily Standup Format
**Time**: 9:00 AM JST (flexible based on Nao's schedule)

**Questions**:
- What did we complete yesterday?
- What are we working on today?  
- Any blockers or concerns?
- Token usage improvements measured?

## Sprint Success Criteria
- [ ] 60%+ reduction in average token usage per session
- [ ] GPT-5 configuration successfully implemented
- [ ] Memory MCP integration functional
- [ ] All tests passing with performance improvements
- [ ] Documentation updated for hybrid usage

## Risk Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking existing functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite before changes
- **Risk**: Over-optimization affecting user experience
  - **Mitigation**: Nao feedback loop for UX validation
- **Risk**: Integration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Modular implementation with rollback capability

## Definition of Done
1. Code reviewed and tested
2. Performance metrics demonstrate improvement
3. Documentation updated
4. Nao approval for user-facing changes
5. Hybrid system compatibility confirmed
